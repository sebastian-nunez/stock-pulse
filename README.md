## Tables

In this schema, we have the following relationships:

1. **One-to-Many Relationship (Category to Products):**

   - Each product belongs to one category.

2. **Many-to-Many Relationship (Products to Tags):**
   - Products can have multiple tags, and each tag can be associated with multiple products.

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We got the product browser/inventory view set up alongside some notification and user friendly-error messages for both the frontend and the backend.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Creating the Product Info/edit/create forms and modals were difficult. There were a couple of new technologies that were implemented via documentation.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes. We need to make the category and tag modals alongside the table view "dashboard". After that, we can work on creating the landing page alongside the login via OAuth.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

None

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Setting up OAuth.
